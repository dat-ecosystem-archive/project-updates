# Cabal

Cabal is an experimental p2p community chat platform, focusing on group chat in channels. 

Currently there exists a [terminal client](https://github.com/cabal-club/cabal-cli) and a [desktop client](https://github.com/cabal-club/cabal-desktop/),
with plans on mobile and web clients underway.
