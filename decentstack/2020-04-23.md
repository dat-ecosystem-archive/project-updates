## The Big Push

Spring is here and I'm cleaning out my disks for pending releases.

Much has happend since last time, I have now started a company. (site not up yet)
_Decent Labs AB_ has opened the doors ðŸ¥‚ - no real changes I'm investing surplus time and money into this project as usual.
Also, im not affiliated to decentlabs.io nor decentlab.com (*facepalm*)
If anyone of you knows them please forward a message: "Greetings, I come in peace! let us continue our work decentrally."

I'm slowly learning my own limitations working solo, gonna try
to increase the release frequencey by doing the releases smaller and dirtier.

These are the latest experiments to design "a" decentstack,
I'm exploring alternative ways to create decentralized
applications in order to expand our current tool box:

- [hyperplexer](https://github.com/decentstack/hyperplexer) UNRELEASED ->  0.9.0
- [hypercorder](https://github.com/decentstack/hypercorder) UNRELEASED -> 0.0.1
- [hyper-simulator](https://github.com/decentstack/hyper-simulator) 0.8.1 -> 1.3.0
- [picofeed](https://github.com/telamon/picofeed) UNRELEASED -> 2.0.0
- [rant](https://github.com/telamon/rant) UNRELEASED -> 0.6.0-alpha
- [juke](https://github.com/telamon/juke) UNRELEASED -> 0.2.0-alpha



## [hyperplexer](https://github.com/decentstack/hyperplexer)

This is my continued work and fork of `multifeed` that's been in progress
since last summer.. **phew** feels good to finally see it published.

It's a fully functional storage agnostic replication manager for hypercores.

Feed hotswapping is not implemented yet, meaning it won't handle 500+ live feeds just yet,
but it's a well structured rewrite of the `mux` component in `multifeed`.

## [hypercorder](https://github.com/decentstack/hypercorder)

This is a bit of hot potato...

"Design your own concensus" - Many to One feed encoder.

If you can imagine a swarm topic with multiple feeds being a room
full of voices; then hypercorder is the equivalent of a voice-recorder that collects all observed statements into a single recording.

It 'centralizes' facts using a pluggable `filter` function.
The output is stored in a hypercore feed which in turn can be decentrally distributed given an audience that trusts the recorder.

Main purpose is to improve replication efficiency in scenarios where you have
a finite number of writers and and a great amount of read-only consumers.

I also believe it can be used to build stupid things that waste resources,
let's not do that.

## [hyper-simulator](https://github.com/decentstack/hyper-simulator)

I'm very happy to mention the hyper-simulator again, It has been
a real time-saver, proven itself very effective at triggering bugs
that would otherwise only appear during live network conditions.

The new 1.3.0 includes a flashy new event queue and
some stability patches (hyper-simulator has
also shown great aptitude for triggering internal bugs..)

Also a couple of new undocumented aggregation-counters.
(check hypercorder/scenarios/ for example)

## [picofeed](https://github.com/telamon/picofeed)

Turns out that even if you can save time at finding network-issues,
debugging and fixing still takes lots of time...

```js
const network = Infinity
network * 0.5 // => Infinity
```

So after many frustrations I decided to see if
I could build an decentralized application able
to communicate **without a network**.

#### Enter picofeed

Picofeed is a tiny single buffer block chain, a secure
feed where each 'block' consists of:

- ParentSignature
- App-data
- Signature

It's small enough to be encoded into a URL, thus instead
of using an active network It can be passively replicated
with one click.

Given that the click lands on an application capable of reading
and appending to the feed, then If the user can be successfully
motivated to share a 'new' Link.

Then we have effecitvely shown that it's possible to securely
mutate the state of one browser session from another
without direct use of a network.

Not quite sure of the potential, but I had fun developing theese two
decentralized toy-apps which use picofeed as storage.

#### [rant](https://github.com/telamon/rant)
Markdown editor capable of producing/reading/encrypting 1kB documents.

#### [juke](https://github.com/telamon/juke)
Chiptune-Jukebox with ejectable cassettes.

_I mentioned them being decentralized right?_

Both apps are packed into single HTML files, making them entierly self contained.
Which means if you hit `Ctrl/Command+S` to save the page, you get a fully functional complete copy of the application capable of reading and writing picofeeds
securely and without a central node.

Am I doing it right? :D
